- ✅ Loading states during data fetch
- ✅ No results messages for filtering
- ✅ Network error handling
- ✅ Helpful empty state messages with clear actions

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run with custom test runner
node tests/test-runner.js

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.js
```

### Test Configuration
The tests are configured to run in:
- **Headless Chromium** (as requested)
- **Local development server** (http://localhost:3000)
- **Parallel execution** for faster results
- **Screenshot on failure** for debugging
- **Video recording on failure** for analysis

## 🔧 Test Setup

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.js`)
- Headless Chromium browser
- Automatic server startup
- HTML reporter for detailed results
- Trace collection on retry
- Screenshot and video capture on failure

### Mock Data Strategy
The tests use client-side mocking to simulate:
- Authenticated user states
- Admin vs user roles
- Empty data scenarios
- Network failures

## 📊 Test Results

After running tests, you can view detailed results:
```bash
# View HTML report
npx playwright show-report

# View trace for failed tests
npx playwright show-trace test-results/[test-name]/trace.zip
```

## 🎨 Key Features Tested

### Authentication Flow
- Login form validation
- Role-based redirects
- Password reset workflow
- Signup navigation

### Document Management
- Admin upload capabilities
- Document categorization
- Access level restrictions
- File type validation

### Family Explorer
- Hierarchical location filtering (State → District → Sub-district → City → Village)
- Multiple view modes for family trees
- Advanced search and filtering
- Member detail modals
- Migration tracking

### Access Control
- Admin vs user permissions
- Route protection
- Feature availability based on role
- Document access levels

### User Experience
- Empty state handling
- Loading indicators
- Error recovery
- Mobile responsiveness

## 🔍 Test Strategy

### Robust Selectors
Tests use multiple selector strategies:
- Text content matching
- CSS class selectors
- Role-based selectors
- Accessible element targeting

### Error Handling
Tests account for:
- Network timeouts
- Missing elements
- Dynamic loading
- Authentication failures

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
While focused on Chromium, the test structure supports:
- Multiple browser configurations
- Responsive design testing
- Performance monitoring

## 📈 Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to integrate with CI/CD pipelines:
- Fast execution in headless mode
- Detailed reporting
- Exit codes for build status
- Artifact collection (screenshots, videos, traces)

## 🛠️ Customization

To adapt tests for your specific environment:

1. **Update base URL** in `playwright.config.js`
2. **Modify authentication** mock data in test files
3. **Adjust selectors** if UI changes
4. **Add environment-specific** configurations

## 📝 Notes

- Tests are designed to work with or without actual backend data
- Mock authentication allows testing without real Supabase setup
- Flexible selectors adapt to UI changes
- Comprehensive coverage ensures reliable testing

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Server startup timeout**: Increase timeout in config
2. **Element not found**: Check if selectors match your UI
3. **Authentication issues**: Verify mock auth setup
4. **Slow tests**: Check network conditions and server performance

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of your React application's functionality, ensuring robust testing of authentication, document management, family exploration with filtering, role-based access control, and fallback UI scenarios.
